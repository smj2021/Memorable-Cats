Title: Memorable Cats -- A Game of Memories... and Cats

Getting Started: https://smj2021.github.io/Memorable-Cats/

Instructions: The game is pretty simple. Click to start. Keep clicking until you have matched all the cards. You only lose if you quit. Just like life.

Stack Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Next Steps: In the future, I would like to include a move counter to capture how many clicks were made before the player matched all the cards.

I am still on the fence about a timer, but think it would be appropriate to encourage fast clicking, and player improvement over time.

Beyond that, I would like to add a counter to track how many iterations of the game are played in a single sitting and output statistics about player activity (time between clicks, time between matches, fastest win, slowest win).

Another addition I would maybe like to make is a heatmap output to show players which area of the board they tend to favor at the beginning of a game, which may help adjust click strategy.
